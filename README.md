**Decentralised_VMS** is a decentralized vehicle management system that allows you to efficiently manage the vehicle credentials and modification done in it by the time.

### 💫 How it works
- It begins at the root level where the manufacturer registers a vehicle with the system. When the vehicle is launched in the market, it is sold to a retailer for a predefined price. A customer can then purchase this vehicle from the company. All of these transactions are recorded in the blockchain and this makes this flow more transparent. 
- The entire history of the vehicle is also displayed to the users, where they can see how the vehicle has been handed along since it was manufactured. This prevents the introduction of counterfeit products in the market. This can be especially useful for keeping track of branded products and spareparts.
- It also allows the users to commit financial transactions via Ethereum blockchain network. This makes the entire trade and commerce more secure and safe. 
- The entire process of supply chain management is made digital which makes the operations and logistics run smoothly
